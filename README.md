#### Fire_Fighting_Bot

#### Project Description:
This project involves the design and development of a Fire Fighting Bot using an Arduino board. The primary objective of the bot is to automatically detect and extinguish fires while also providing manual control via a mobile application.

#### Features:
- Automatic fire detection and extinguishing capabilities.
- Manual control functionality via a mobile application for user interaction.
  
#### Components:
- Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Sensors for fire detection (e.g., flame sensors, temperature sensors)
- Actuators for fire suppression (e.g., water pumps, servo motors)
- Mobile application for manual control (e.g., developed using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi communication)

#### Future Enhancements:
- Integration of advanced sensors for enhanced fire detection accuracy.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for intelligent fire prediction and suppression.
- Integration with IoT platforms for remote monitoring and control.
- Development of a user-friendly interface for the mobile application with additional features.
